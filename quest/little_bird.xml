<date>26.04.01</date><cover source="media/bird.gif"/><intro>This is just a sample quest using the include command. By the station interconnections you can see the bird is seperated. The bird acts differently depending on what happens (the player can find an apple to feed it to the bird). Station interconnections can be displayed by pressing Ctrl+F1 in the editor.</intro>

There once was a love bird
High up in the sky
All day flying around
Doesn't matter much why
Well it mighta been lonely
Or a little bit sad
Or it might well just be
Love birds are plain mad
